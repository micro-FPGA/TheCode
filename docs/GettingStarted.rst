Source (Quellcode) code is normally written by humans. Machine (or a computer program) can also generate source code during the translation process of the original quellcode, this would be "generated source code" and should normally not be read or modified by the humans.  


Source (quell) code
=================== 





Comments
========

Most languages have a concept of adding comments to the source code. Comments are text blocks that are mostly meant to be read by humans. They are usually skipped if read by the machine.

Comments can be of two different styles, either
 * line end comment - comment ends at end of line
 * block comment - comment text can span multiple lines
 
Common line end comment delimiters are
 * ``#``
 * ``//``
 * ``--``
 * ``REM``
  
Common block comment delimiters are  
 * ``/*`` .. ``*/`` 
 * ``(*`` .. ``*)``
 
 
Statements
==========

End of simple statement (sentence) is usually
 * end of line
 * ``;``

Block statements are blocks of statements that are grouped together, usually marked by
 * ``begin`` .. ``end``
 * ``{`` .. ``}``
 * ``(`` .. ``)``
