Comments
========

Most languages have a concept of adding Comments to the source code. Comments are text blocks that are mostly meant to be read by humans. They are usually skipped if read by the machine.

Comments can be of two different styles, either
 * line end comment - comment ends at end of line
 * block comment - comment text can span multiple lines
 
Common line end comment delimiters are
 * ``#``
 * ``//``
 * ``--``
 * ``REM``
  
Common block comment delimiters are  
 * ``/*`` .. ``*/`` 
 * ``(*`` .. ``*)``
 
 
 Statements
==========

End of simple statement (sentence) is usually
 * end of line
 * ``;``

Block statements are blocks of statements that are grouped together, usually marked by
 * ``begin`` .. ``end``
 * ``{`` .. ``}``
 * ``(`` .. ``)``
